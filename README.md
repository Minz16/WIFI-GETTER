# WIFI-GETTER
Batch file to get the wifi password. To get a little tutorial for the program, you have to execute it and type in 'help' or '?'. But you can also look at the releases. Everone has a tutorial implemented.

## Virus?

Even though your PC might think this file is a virus, its not. You can simpy see it on the code, however  this might be also a problem when you start the program, then you just need to allow it to run.
If you are still suspicious about it, you can start the file on a empty folder and without executing it as admin. However the program is also fully useable without admin permission.
But you could either copy the code, if you want to.

## Special Thanks

Im thanking ┬úunL╦å for great help in programming the most.
